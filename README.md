This project is called Game of Drones!!!, a fancy name for rock, papers and scissors. just a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `let's npm start`

In game of Drones you can challenge anyone.
In the  main menu you MUST enter  your names, as soon as you hit enter you'll be registered in our database.
Then, pick either rock, scissors or paper. Turn around as your friend picks something too.
Hit next and let the showdown begin!!! The first player to win 3 rounds wins the match.

After the match is complete you'll be able to see the scoreboard with the names and scores of all the other players.
